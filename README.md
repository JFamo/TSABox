# TSABox

## About
TSABox is an improvement of the ChapterSweet project, found here https://github.com/Megastardaboss/chaptersweet.
It is a comprehensive suite of web-based tools to facilitate the operation of Technology Student Association chapters.
It is comprised of three areas with different utilities.

### OfficerBox
The OfficerBox contains a page for the duties of each chapter officer position including Plan of Work management, balance tracking, automatically generated parliamentary procedure tests with a live scoreboard, and chapter-wide announcements.

### EventsBox
The EventsBox is where users can browse and download event rules, sign up for events, and view the designated space for their teams. In this area they have links to the social profiles of all teammates, task progress tracking and metrics, and a shared filespace for each team. Advisers can view an iServices compatible output of all chapter teams.

### SocialBox
The SocialBox contains the social functionality of TSABox, allowing users to represent themselves with a profile, blog, and bio, and connect to other TSABox users across the world.
